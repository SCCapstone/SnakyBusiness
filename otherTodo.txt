
====== Auden's todo ===============================================================================================

- Graphics method to control opacity of media frame to draw frame. 100% and variable% or variable% and 255-variable%, test to find out.

- Radial brush, wrap editor in proper window with controls. Put in QMainWindow and query the info back upon close. 
  Must be aware of brush max size and use graphics zoom to increase size to fit window.

- Add triangle rendering to vector rendering.

- speciality filters including painting, guassian blur, orb for screen filters.

- Editing, select, cut, paste, copy, move, delete, paint bucket, etc? non-square/rectangle edits?

----- quick / optional ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Pixelation brush.

- Filter similar to polarize, but showing color (need above and below versions).

- Distorion map brush if time permits.

- Transitions, maybe even alpha transitions, if time permits.

====== Team working on Data and UI =========================================================================================================

- Use QMainWindow for pattern editor, custom brush editor, Radial brush editor, and filter applicator. 
  If there will ever be a distortion map brush, it will need one too.

- Undo and redo (see memDetail.txt)

- Frame via io handler. File, in out & import export. special file io for draw frames, stram io for media frame 
  via qMediaPlayer and QAbstractVideoSurface inherited obj overloading present method. (see saveLoad.txt)
  This is going to be complex so hold off on this for until we can discuss it. Needs to be done by the Dec 4th for the POC.

- UI, video track bar, side bars. ATTACH LINKS HERE.
	for track bars, use QLabel and set it's pixmap and mask to that of the QImage. Potentially do something
	with setSizePolicy and setScaledContents. add these to a QHBoxLayout and make this the layout for a QScrollArea.
