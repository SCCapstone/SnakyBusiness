# Glass Opus

This first paragraph should be a short description of the app. You can add links
to your wiki pages that have more detailed descriptions.

Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team.
Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer
can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only
useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything
because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be
following your instructions.

## External Requirements

The app should be able to be run by using the executable in the bin folder.

## Setup

1. Install open source [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source?hsCtaTracking=9f6a2170-a938-42df-a8e2-a9f0b1d6cdce%7C6cb0de4f-9bb5-4778-ab02-bfb62735f3e5)
2. Install [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) libraries. [Tutorial](https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_setup_Qt_and_openCV_on_Windows) if needed.

## Running

Once Qt and the OpenCV libs have been correctly installed, one must open the project in Qt and press the run button in the bottom left of the Qt gui, or run the executable in the bin folder. 

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
